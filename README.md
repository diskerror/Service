# API clients
These are older solutions for connecting to some data center management systems. They use a combination of my, now deprecated, utilities and some Zend Frameworks 1 & 2. This requires using both PSR-0 and PSR-4 autoloading.

So, using the code as-is is not recommended. These are just for reference. Details for making these clients were hard to come by so hopefully having them all in one place will make it an easier task for the next person to build and improve upon.

Code for clients include:
- F5
- Spacewalk
- Foreman (uses CURL)
- ActiveDirectory (LDAP)
- VCenter

Offered with the Unlicensed license. You are free to use at will.
